## What have gone in process to make this project
This app is able to work faster with high performances due to the considerations I took care of like: 
* Asynchronous programing 
For scalability of the database request and fast speed. 
* Implementing Interfaces 
For better readability of the code and some abstracted codes to avoided to much code repetition. Making of scooped and Singleton repositories and services. 
* Login/Register with Google implemented 
* Blog comments functionality. 
* Implemented Authentication and Authorization 
By adding each user üë• to their respective roles. To determine who can access the admin or Blog area and some private pages in the app. 

* **Froala HTML Editor** for add or editing the blog content. 
* Blog image optimization to slow loading/speed of the pages. 
* Attractive User üë• Interface
